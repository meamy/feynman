-- This one is subtle. Only appears in certain configurations of the

-- form are irreducible. Simplest way to fix this is to fix the
-- irreducibility of those normal forms. Problem here is that
-- x0 + x1 + x2y0 is not computable in the final stage, but the variable y0
-- can be removed from the output by a computable transformation.
-- Alternatively, some changes of variables (hence some normalizations)
-- make this computable, but it may be possible to manufacture a situation
-- where this isn't possible. Curious
